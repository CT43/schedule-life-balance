##Welcome to Schedule-life-balance!

*this app is designed to be used with the schedule-life-balance-api at https://github.com/CT43/schedule-life-balance-api*

This app allows a user to create daily schedules and view how they are allocating their time in a given schedule with the rendered chart.
Designed to give a tangible feel to time and building out a schedule or to do list.

To use: Clone both this repository and the linked repository above. With two terminals running, cd into each of the two files. Inside the schedule-balance-api run bundle install and start up the server with '$ rails s -p 3001' and in the schedule-balance directory on the other terminal run '$ npm install' and then '$ npm start'

Once inside the application, begin by creating a new schedule via the button on top, from here you can fill the schedule with activities and see the results of your time allocation. You are able to retrieve past schedules with their id, delete schedules, and delete activities as well. The chart will update to all of your activities in real time.

Enjoy!
